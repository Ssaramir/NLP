# Medical Transcription Classification

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying medical transcription texts into various categories using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build and evaluate different models to determine the most effective approach for this classification task.

## Goal

The primary objective of this project is to accurately classify medical transcription texts into predefined categories. This involves preprocessing the text data, applying various machine learning and deep learning models, and evaluating their performance.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- **Text Cleaning**: Removal of special characters, numbers, and stopwords to clean the text data.
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
- **Vectorization**: Converting text data into numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF and embeddings.

### Models

1. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**:
   - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
   - Suitable for text classification due to its efficiency on small datasets.

2. **Random Forest**:
   - An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees.
   - Handles overfitting better and improves accuracy.

3. **MLP Classifier (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**:
   - A deep learning model with multiple hidden layers.
   - Capable of learning complex patterns in data.

4. **Transformers (BERT/RoBERTa)**:
   - State-of-the-art language models for NLP tasks.
   - Fine-tuned for text classification to leverage their powerful contextual understanding.

### Evaluation

- **Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy are used to evaluate model performance.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Results

- **Class Imbalance**: Addressed using oversampling techniques to improve model performance on minority classes.
- **Model Comparison**: 
  - **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Provided a quick baseline but struggled with class imbalance.
  - **Random Forest**: Improved performance but had limitations in capturing complex text patterns.
  - **MLP Classifier**: Demonstrated better performance with deeper understanding but required significant computational resources.
  - **Transformers**: Achieved the best results with superior contextual understanding and handling of text nuances.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the effectiveness of advanced NLP models like BERT/RoBERTa in classifying medical transcription texts. The findings indicate that these models significantly outperform traditional methods in this domain.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further optimization of model parameters to enhance performance.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to improve accuracy and robustness.
- **Real-Time Deployment**: Implementing the best-performing model in a real-time application for practical use.
